# TranslateIt
> An ios app that allows you to learn languages by playing games.

### Requirements

* ios 13 + 
* xcode 13.2 +
* cocoapods 1.11.2

### Dependencies

Following Third-party dependencies are added via cocoa pods.

* RxSwift (reactive programming)
* RxTests (unit testing)
 
### Design Pattern
The MVVM Design pattern is used. It helps us to separate business logic from UI and makes testing easier.
 
### Testing 
Unit Testing and Basic UI Tests are done


### How much time was invested
 Around 8 hours, 2 hours for Milestone1, 3 for Milestone2 and 3 for Milestone3

### How was the time distributed (concept, model layer, view(s), game mechanics)
Around 30 minutes for understanding projects, around 2 hour for model layer, around 2 hour for game Mechanics, 1 hour for result view and around 2.5 hours for testing


### Decisions made to solve certain aspects of the game
Game Data Provider provides 25 % of the correct pairs where as rest 75% can be either correct or wrong

### Decisions made because of restricted time
Didn't focus on UI part
Didn't unit test timer part

‚óè What would be the first thing to improve or add if there had been more time
Increase Test Coverage

### Future Plans
* Improve UI
* More test coverage (UI Tests, Snapshot Tests, Integration Tests)
* CI/CD
